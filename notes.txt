API security:

UserID and Password based authentication

How is the userID and password supplied to the API call?
- in header
- redirection to a auth provider
- Does the API require authentication every time it is invoked?
- What do we store as a part of the authentication?
    - Do we create a user session or security principal?
    - Do we take the IP address of the user who has sent the request?
